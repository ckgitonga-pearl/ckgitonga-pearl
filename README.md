👩‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I’m Caroline, a curious mind on an exciting journey to become a front-end developer! 🚀
Right now, I’m learning the magic behind HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and every new concept feels like unlocking a hidden level in a game 🎮.
I love experimenting with colors, layouts, and interactivity — turning simple code into something that feels alive. ✨
You’ll probably catch me celebrating small wins like fixing my first bug or making a button actually do something 😂.
